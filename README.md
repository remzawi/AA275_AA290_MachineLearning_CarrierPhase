Repository for my AA275 and AA290 Stanford projects 
I implement tools to compute double difference measurements from RINEX files in Python, including reading the files, computing the geometry matrix and forming the measurements from the carrier pahse observable.
I implement a bseline method to compute the integers using the LAMBDA algorithm. This algorithm can be found in Python exclusively at this link: https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/geoscience-remote-sensing/research/lambda/lambda/ (it is not uploaded here and part of the code won't work without the LAMBDA.py file in the working folder).
I implement double difference data simulation software in Python to generate high amount of data.
I implement models to study various applications of data-driven approaches for integer ambiguity resolution and carrier phase positionning.
